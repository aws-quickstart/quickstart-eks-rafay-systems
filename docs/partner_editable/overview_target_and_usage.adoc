This Quick Start reference deployment guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying Rafay’s Kubernetes Operations Platform (KOP) for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) management and operations. With KOP, your platform and site-reliability engineering (SRE) teams can deploy, operate, and manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes clusters and containerized applications in both AWS Cloud and on-premises environments.

This Quick Start is for IT and DevOps professionals who want to deploy Kubernetes clusters in the AWS Cloud, in data centers, and at network edges. KOP uses a software as a service (SaaS) management console that automates multicluster provisioning, configuration management, and upgrades. It also automates the deployment of containerized applications and enables access to Kubernetes clusters through a zero-trust connectivity model.

Through a single user interface, KOP provides enterprise-grade capabilities, such as monitoring and visibility across AWS Regions, role-based access control, and governance.


=== KOP on AWS

KOP manages the complete lifecycle of native Kubernetes services. You can programmatically (or via the KOP console) create and configure EKS clusters and core infrastructure components, such as computation, storage, and networking. For high-availability clusters, KOP automatically provisions worker nodes across three Availability Zones.

This approach is agnostic to the type and provider of the underlying infrastructure and is designed to work with bare-metal servers and virtual machines. When pre-existing clusters are provisioned or imported into KOP, KOP provides a source of visibility and lifecycle management for applications and clusters across environments. The benefits of this include the following:

* *One console across AWS Regions and on-premises:* Use a single console to deploy, view, and manage clusters and workloads across clusters.
* *Apply enterprise-grade K8 security on AWS:* Rafay’s zero-trust architecture for Kubernetes lets enterprises conceal Kubernetes API endpoints on AWS without affecting continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) and developer workflows.
* *Multicluster application deployment across environments:* Rafay’s zero-trust architecture for Kubernetes lets enterprises deploy containerized applications using existing CI/CD systems or via Rafay’s GitOps feature set.
