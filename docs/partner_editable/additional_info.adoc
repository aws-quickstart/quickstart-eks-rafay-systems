1.	Log in to the Rafay console. New Rafay customers will receive an email with a user name, password, and link to the Rafay console.
2.	Navigate to *Infrastructure* and then *Clusters* for details about the newly imported cluster, as shown in the following figure.

The following are important considerations related to the Rafay Systems MKP:

* Roles-based access control and Amazon IAM

* You can automate the provisioning and lifecycle management of Amazon EKS clusters in all supported AWS Regions.

* With auto provisioning, you can deploy a cluster in moments. In order to do this, you must provide credentials that allow programmatic access to Amazon AWS.

* Two types of credentials are supported: IAM Role and IAM User. For more information about how to create and configure MKP credentials, see the https://docs.rafay.co/clusters/provision/eks/credentials/[MKP documentation^].

=== Email allow listing

A third-party service is used for emails sent by the controller (for example, for first-time user activation, password resets, and notifications). To help ensure delivery of emails from the SaaS controller to users in your organization, we recommend using an IP allow list for inbound traffic. The dedicated IP address used for sending emails from the Rafay controller is `149.72.39.92`.

=== Network firewall rules

The Rafay controller is designed for customers to deploy and manage clusters in both public and on-premises environments. To onboard an on-premises or cloud-based cluster  for ongoing operations and lifecycle management, ensure the following:

* A Kubernetes operator is installed on each managed cluster. This establishes and maintains an outbound TLS-based control channel for the Rafay controller, which is hosted on AWS for SaaS.
* No inbound ports are opened on the customer's external firewall for Rafay control-plane traffic.

The Rafay Kubernetes operator uses only `TCP Port 443, Outbound` to communicate with the Rafay controller.

=== Controller details

Customers who want greater security can add the IP addresses and FQDNs of the SaaS Rafay controller to their firewalls. This helps to ensure that outbound connectivity is only allowed through these IPs. The Rafay SaaS controller is highly available across three Availability Zones (AZs) on AWS. For more information, see https://docs.rafay.co/security/overview/[Rafay's security overview^].



== Other useful information
//Provide any other information of interest to users, especially focusing on areas where AWS or cloud usage differs from on-premises usage.
