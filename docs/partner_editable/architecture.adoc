Deploying this Quick Start for a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with
default parameters builds the following {partner-product-short-name} environment in the
AWS Cloud. Note that this module is based on the https://prod-us-west-2.aem-author.marketing.aws.a2z.com/content/aws.amazon.com/staging/en_US/quickstart/architecture/amazon-eks.html[Modular and Scalable Amazon EKS Architecture^] Quick Start.

//.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
//image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[width=100%,height=100%]

//As shown in <<architecture>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** Linux bastion hosts in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to Amazon EC2 instances in the private subnets. The bastion host is configured with the Kubernetes Kubectl command line interface for managing the Kubernetes cluster.
* In the private subnets:
* A group of Kubernetes nodes in an Auto Scaling group that run the Rafay Operator software with tie-ins to the Rafay SaaS controller.
* Amazon EKS, which creates the Kubernetes control plane.



// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
