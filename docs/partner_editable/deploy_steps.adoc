// Adapt the following warning to your Quick Start.
WARNING: If you set up {partner-product-short-name} with an existing VPC, ensure that your VPC has two private subnets in different Availability Zones for the workload instances and that the subnets aren’t shared. This Quick Start doesn’t support https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html

//TODO If the QS doesn't support shared subnets, why include the following sentence about route tables?

[shared subnets^]. These subnets require https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html[NAT gateways^] in their route tables, to allow the instances to download packages and software without exposing them to the internet. Also ensure that the domain name in the DHCP options is configured according to the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html[DHCP options sets^]. Provide your VPC settings when you launch the Quick Start.
