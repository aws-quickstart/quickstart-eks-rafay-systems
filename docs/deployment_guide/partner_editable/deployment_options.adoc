// Edit this placeholder text as necessary to describe the deployment options.

This Partner Solution provides the following deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a new VPC*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new VPC.
* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC*. This option provisions {partner-product-short-name} in your existing AWS infrastructure.
* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} KMC into an existing EKS Cluster*. This option deploys the Rafay Kubernetes Operator into your existing EKS cluster. When deploying into an EKS cluster that was not created by the https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/amazon-eks/[Amazon EKS^] Quick Start, you must prepare the cluster as described in the link:#_deployment_steps[Deployment steps] section.

This Partner Solution provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and {partner-product-short-name} settings.
